## Testing Tips

1. **Try extreme positions**: Test corners of the matrix (very casual + very friendly vs very formal + very professional)

2. **Test incremental changes**: Move one step at a time to see subtle differences

3. **Use varied content**: Try different types of text (emails, social posts, technical docs)

4. **Check context preservation**: Ensure the core message remains intact while tone changes

5. **Test edge cases**: Very short texts, very long texts, texts with special formatting

6. **Mix content types**: Try business emails with casual settings, or personal messages with formal settings

## Quality Indicators

Good tone adjustments should:
- ✅ **Preserve meaning** - Core message stays the same
- ✅ **Match requested tone** - Formality/friendliness aligns with selection  
- ✅ **Sound natural** - Result feels authentic, not robotic
- ✅ **Maintain context** - Appropriate for the content type
- ✅ **Show clear difference** - Noticeable change from original

Poor results might:
- ❌ Change the core meaning
- ❌ Sound awkward or unnatural  
- ❌ Miss the tone target completely
- ❌ Add inappropriate content
- ❌ Be identical to the original (when tone change was requested)
